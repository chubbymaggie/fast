fast (0.0.3-1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * parse smali code using ANTLR C++. (Closes: #XXXXXX)
    * Added support to ANTLR4 in C++ (which unfortunately caused a conflict in the older dependencies of antlr@2 (required by srcml). There is a workaround 
      (see an update to the installation guide.)
    * Modified the code schema to place "tail" information after "child", so that it is easier to remove the shift-reduce error in the application of BiYacc
    * Generalised the schema to support other type of information for automated software engineering, such as slicing and diff-patch
