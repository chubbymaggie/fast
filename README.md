# `fast` -- Flattening Abstract Syntax Trees
This tool flattens code structures of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) as binary so that it is more efficient to load and save them between memory and disk, avoiding re-parsing altogether.

## Performance
In the benchmarks folder if you check out from the `git` repository, you will see much larger examples where `fast` has been applied to speed up the parsing process by up to 100 times. 

![Benchmarks 1. Most popular projects in 5 programming languages](https://github.com/yijunyu/fast/raw/master/benchmarks/benchmarks1.png "The projects are selected from those with the most stars on GitHub.")

![Benchmarks 2. Bug related commits in evolving artefacts in Java](https://github.com/yijunyu/fast/raw/master/benchmarks/benchmarks2.png "The projects are selected from academic studies on the bug localization problems.")

That's part of the reasons why we call it "fast".

A report on performance evaluation will be placed under the `doc/` subfolder.

## Dependencies
The current implementation is based on `protobuf` and `flatbuffers`, as well as `srcml` which parses code to XML, and [`rapidxml`](https://github.com/dwd/rapidxml) which parses XML documents.

To get it working, we have already included `rapidxml` code in the source, but it has dependencies on the following software:

* [srcML](http://www.srcml.org/)

* [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)

* [flatbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)

If they aren't installed, the following commands will get them installed:
### MacOSX using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) 
```
	$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	$ brew tap yijunyu/fast
	$ brew install fast
```
The 1st line is optional, it will install Homebrew if you hadn't got it.
### Ubuntu Linux using Debian packages:
```
	$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
	$ sudo echo deb http://yijunyu.github.io/ubuntu ./ >> /etc/apt/sources.list
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install fast
```
Specifically, the 1st line is to support HTTPS transport protocol for the repository on github.io; 
the 2nd line is to update the list of repositories on your machine.
## Usage
The use of the tool is fairly simple. It accepts two file arguments on the command line.
Assuming that you have set `/usr/local/bin` in the `$PATH` variable, just enter
```
	$ fast $input_file_name1.$ext1 $output_file_name2.$ext2
```
Here `$name` is the base name of a file. If `$ext1` is not one of the extensions such as
```
	.pb, .fbs
```
SrcML will be called first to turn them into XML format. If the `$ext1` or `$ext2` is one of these formats, the corresponding load / save functions of `fast` will be invoked to save them into the corresponding binary form.

Here are a few examples:
```
	$ fast test/Hello.java Hello.xml
	$ fast test/test.cc test.xml
```
These commands will translate the `Hello.java` Java code or the `test.cc` C++ code
into the corresponding XML document `Hello.xml` or `test.xml`, respectively.
```
	$ fast Hello.xml Hello.java
```
This command will translate the XML document `Hello.xml` back into the corresponding Java code `Hello.java`.
```
	$ fast Hello.xml Hello.pb
	$ fast test.xml test.fbs
```
These commands will translate the XML document `Hello.xml` into the corresponding Protocol Buffer (`.pb`) or 
FlatBuffers (`.fbs`) binary in `Hello.pb` or `Hello.fbs`, respectively.
```
	$ fast Hello.pb Hello.xml
	$ fast test.fbs test.xml
```
These commands will translate the binary representations into the corresponding XML document `Hello.xml`.
```
	$ fast Hello.pb Hello.java
	$ fast test.fbs test.cc
```
These commands will translate the binary representations into the corresponding code files.
```
	$ fast -t Hello.pb
```
This command will print the textual representation of the protocol buffer using the generated fAST schema.
```
	$ fast -p Hello.java Hello.pb
	$ fast -p Hello.pb Hello.xml
```
These commands will keep the line/column positions of the code elements in the
corresponding binary and XML documents.  Note that if "-p" option is not
provided, even if the protobuf document has the code elements' position
information, they will not be skipped in the XML document.
```
	$ fast -p test.cc test.pb
	$ fast -s test.pb
	$ fast -s Hello.java
```
These commands perform forward program slicing on the source code using the srcSlice tool. Current implementation makes use of srcML as intermediate format,
even though the PB binary AST equivalent can be more efficient. TODO: we are going to replace the XML parser in srcSlice to enable more efficient slicing.
