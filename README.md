# `fast` -- Flat Abstract Syntax Trees

Usually abstract syntax trees (ASTs) are considered as hierarchical, recursive
structures for representing source code.  Parsing code into ASTs, however,
typically requires a full traversal of such trees.  

Can we think differently?

Instead of parsing the code structures, why cannot they be loaded into the
memory before any further analysis? 

This project adopts flatbuffers, a more efficient binary structure to represent
the ASTs, and demonstates its wide applicability to various software
development tasks.

[Once installed](doc/installation.md), [our tool](doc/options.md)
[manipulates](doc/usage.md) [source code](doc/example.md) [10x
faster](doc/performance.md). 

Your software development projects may benefit directly from `fast` if you have
used one of the following related tools:

* [antlr3](https://github.com/antlr/antlr3)
* [biyacc](http://biyacc.yozora.moe)
* [flatbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)
* [gumtreediff](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree)
* [meaningful-changes](https://github.com/yijunyu/meaningful-changes)
* [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
* [rapidxml](https://github.com/dwd/rapidxml)
* [smali](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali)
* [srcML](http://www.srcml.org/)
* [txl](http://txl.ca)
