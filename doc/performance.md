## Performance
In the benchmarks folder if you check out from the `git` repository, you will see much larger examples where `fast` has been applied to speed up the parsing process by up to 100 times. 

![Benchmarks 1. Most popular projects in 5 programming languages](https://github.com/yijunyu/fast/raw/master/benchmarks/benchmarks1.png "The projects are selected from those with the most stars on GitHub.") ![Benchmarks 2. Bug related commits in evolving artefacts in Java](https://github.com/yijunyu/fast/raw/master/benchmarks/benchmarks2.png "The projects are selected from academic studies on the bug localization problems.")

A report on performance evaluation will be placed under the `doc/` subfolder.
