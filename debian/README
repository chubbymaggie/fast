To run srcSlice:

First get a srcML version of your code using srcml with position mark up turned on:

srcml [input file] -o [output file] --position

example: srcml file.cpp -o file.cpp.xml

Then take the file you've stored output in and give it to srcSlice:

./srcSlice [input file]

example: ./srcSlice file.cpp.xml
